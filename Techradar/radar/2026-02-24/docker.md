[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open-source platform for building, shipping, and running applications in containers. It provides a lightweight and efficient way to package software and its dependencies into a standardized unit for deployment. Docker containers are isolated from one another and from the underlying host system, making them portable and easy to deploy across different environments. Docker is widely used in the industry and has a large and active community of contributors. It is a good choice for organizations that want to adopt a container-based approach to application development and deployment.
