[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes provides a powerful platform for running containerized workloads in a production environment, with features such as automatic scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates. It is widely used in the industry and has a large and active community of contributors. Kubernetes is a good choice for organizations that want to run containerized workloads at scale and need a platform that can automate the deployment and management of those workloads.
