[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that is widely used for managing source code and collaborating on software projects. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel and has since become the de facto standard for version control in the software industry. Git provides a powerful set of tools for tracking changes to files, managing branches, and merging code changes from multiple contributors. It supports a wide range of workflows, including centralized, distributed, and feature branching, and is designed to be fast, flexible, and scalable. Git is a key tool for software developers and teams who want to work collaboratively on codebases, track changes over time, and manage the evolution of their projects. It is widely supported by hosting platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, making it easy to share code and collaborate with others. Git is a fundamental tool for modern software development and is a good choice for organizations that want to adopt a robust and efficient version control system.
