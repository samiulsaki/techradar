[Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/) is a domain-specific language (DSL) for defining Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. It is designed to simplify the authoring and management of ARM templates by providing a cleaner and more concise syntax. Bicep is a transparent abstraction over ARM templates, which means that every valid ARM template is also a valid Bicep file. This allows you to leverage existing ARM templates and convert them to Bicep for easier maintenance and readability. Bicep provides features such as type safety, modularity, and code reuse, making it easier to define and manage Azure resources. It also includes built-in functions and modules for common tasks, reducing the need for manual scripting. Bicep is a powerful tool for automating the deployment and management of Azure resources and is a good choice for organizations that want to streamline their infrastructure as code (IaC) workflows.
