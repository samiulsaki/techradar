# How to use the Fluxus Logicae Tech and Tools Radar

TODO: Review this page

### Introduction

Technology is advancing rapidly, with new technologies and innovations constantly emerging.

It is essential for a development and technology company like Fluxus Logicae to continually improve and keep
track of the latest valuable innovations. It is important to actively seek out innovations and new
technologies and periodically question established technologies and methods.

But, it is also important to wisely choose which technologies to use in our daily work and in the
different projects we are carrying out. As we all know: There is no silver bullet.

### What is the Fluxus Logicae Tech and Tools Radar?

This Tech Radar provides an overview of different technologies, including tooling, frameworks, 
tools, and packages, as well as platforms, that we consider 'new or noteworthy.' The radar does not
cover all established technologies; instead, it focuses on items that have recently gained
significance or undergone changes. Items previously featured in the radar are not listed on the
homepage but remain available in the complete overview and search.

### How it is created

The items in the technology radar are suggested by different teams, many of which are related to the
work and challenges faced by the teams in various projects. In fact, we do not include anything on
the radar that we haven't personally tested at least once.

Numerous valuable discussions have taken place in various expert groups regarding the classification
and details of each technology and innovation. The culmination of these discussions is reflected in
the latest technology radar.

### How should it be used

The radar serves as an overview of technologies that we believe everyone in the teams should be
aware of at present.

Its goal is to guide and inspire daily work within the teams. Additionally, it aims to provide
valuable information and a high-level perspective to enable decisions to be made with a deeper
understanding of the subject matter, resulting in more informed and coordinated choices.

We also hope that developers and engineers outside of Fluxus Logicae will find the information in our technology overview
inspiring.

We categorize the items into four quadrants, and sometimes, when it's not entirely clear where an
item belongs, we choose the best fit.

#### The quadrants are:

* **IaC and Automation:** In this category, we focus on technologies related to Infrastructure as Code
  (IaC) and automation tools. This includes tools for provisioning, configuration management, 
  orchestration, and automation.
* **Security:** In this quadrant, we group technologies related to security, including tools for
  scanning, monitoring, and securing software and infrastructure.
* **Infrastructure:** This category includes technologies related to infrastructure, such as
  databases, storage, networking, and other infrastructure-related tools and services.
* **Monitoring:** In this quadrant, we group technologies related to monitoring, observability, and
  logging, including tools for monitoring, logging, and tracing.

#### Each of the items is classified in one of these rings:

* **Adopt:** We wholeheartedly recommend this technology. It has been extensively used in many teams
  for an extended period, proving its stability and utility. Technologies we have high confidence in
  to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our Fluxus Logicae production 
  environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.
* **Trial:** We have successfully implemented this technology and suggest taking a closer look at it
  in this category. The aim here is to scrutinize these items more closely with the intention of
  elevating them to the 'Adopt' level. Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work 
  to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. 
  TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will 
  share knowledge and experiences.
* **Assess:** We have experimented with this technology and find it promising. We recommend
  exploring these items when you encounter a specific need for the technology in your project. Technologies 
  that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest some research 
  and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often 
  brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find some engineers that have knowledge in 
  the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.
* **Hold:** This category is somewhat unique. Unlike the others, it advises discontinuing or
  refraining from using certain technologies. This does not necessarily imply that they are
  inherently bad; it often may be acceptable to use them in existing projects. However, we move
  items here when we believe they should no longer be employed, as we have identified better options
  or alternatives. Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are 
  not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually 
  can be continued for existing projects.
